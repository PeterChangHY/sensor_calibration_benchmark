# Sensor_calibration_benchmark
  This repository will include the instruction of how to  sensor_calibration_benchmark.
  
## how to generate ground truth data

### imu-vehicle-calibration
1. check imu's velocity direction v.s. orientation

### lane-cam-to-imu
1. check golden lane
2. check lane-boundary-connection

## Ground truth format:
 using Comma Separate Values format(.csv) without any header. It should comes with three collumns {Time, Key, value}
 Time: using [Unix Epoch Clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format. 
 Key: a plain string
 Value: a flaot number, for boolean value, we use 1.0 as true, 0.0 as false.
